        <p><a name="Q1"></a>1. How do I know who is using the app? </p>
        <div class="advice1">
        <p>This is important. <br /><br /><b><u>You don't.</u></b><br /><br />
          It is your responsibility to know who you are getting into a car with. 
          There is no vetting or identity verification of people who sign up for the app. 
          Creating a private team that your friends and colleagues can join is an effective way to limit 
          the number of people who can see the rides that the team publishes and who can join your ride.</p>

        <p><a name="Q2"></a>2. What about my vehicle insurance? </p>
        <div class="advice1">
        <p>Deciding to share a ride with someone is a personal decision. 
          You should make sure that your insurance covers you and any passengers that you may have in your vehicle.</p>

      <p><a name="Q3"></a>3. What if my ride is late? </p>
      <div class="advice1">
      <p>Using ShareRides is no different from any other ride sharing or car pooling arrangement. It is your responsibility
        to be at work on time.</p>

      <p><a name="Q4"></a>4. What makes a good carpool participant? </p>
      <div class="advice1">
      <p>Most of the snags experienced using this app at other organizations arose because people
      did not make their expectations clear at the outset. You can avoid almost all of these issues
      by taking a couple of minutes at the start of a ride with someone new to explain your
      expectations around things like punctuality, conduct (e.g. not eating or smoking) and how
      to communicate if something unexpected comes up (by phone or the app).</p>
      <p>Unexpected situations will always come up but if you've discussed how to handle them in
      advance, much of the stress and frustration can be avoided.</p>

    <p><a name="Q5"></a>5. I installed the app. Now what? </p>
      <div class="advice1">
          <p>On the Welcome scene tap on the Sign Up button and create a new user account. 
            Most of the fields are self-explanatory but a couple need a bit of explanation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Email: The email address you provide is used in the event that you forget your password. The email is never shared outside the app.</li>
              <li>Auto approve Requests: If this is turned on (green) then if someone requests a spot in a ride that you've created the 
                request will be approved automatically by the system. 
                If you turn this off (grey) then you will have to individually approve each request.</li>
              <li>Receive Rides notifications: If this is turned on then the system will send a notification 
                to your device if a ride you've signed up for changes.</li>
                <li>Receive update email: The developer will send you very occasional updates about the app if this is turned on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you're registered the app will ask for your permission to show you notifications for things like a 
              change to a ride and your permission to use your location (while you are using the app) to determine whether a ride is close to you. 
              We'd recommend saying yes to both of these but you are free to say no and the app will still work.
              </p>
              <p>You will receive an email from the ShareRides server asking you to click a link to confirm your email address. 
                Please complete this step. The app will start enforcing email validation prior to use at some point in the future.

    <p><a name="Q6"></a>6. What are saved locations? </p>
    <div class="advice1">
    <p>ShareRides depends on the geographic coordinates of a ride to determine whether it is close enough 
      to you to show in your list of available rides. To enable this you will need to create some locations 
      from the Map page. For example, if you frequently travel from your home you could create that location 
      by searching for your address on the map and then tapping the pin at  your home.</p>
      <p>Note that this functionality only works if you answered yes to the request to use your location
        while you are using the app (see Question 3).
      </p>

  </div><br /><br />

  <p><a name="Q7"></a>7. What are Teams? </p>
  <div class="advice1">
  <p>Once you've registered you should either join a Team or create your own Team that others can join. 
    The advantage of using a Team is that the Rides created by team members are private to that Team - no other 
    users can see them or join them.</p>
 <p>If you're creating a team try to use a name and description that will make it easy for your friends 
   and colleagues to find it. Names like "My team" are not as good as "Daily Port to B10 Team" or "Brian M Team".
  </p>
 <p>One point to pay special attention to when you create a team is the "Auto-approve Requests". 
   If you turn this on (green) then anyone who asks to join your team will automatically be approved by the system. 
   This may not be what you want. If you would prefer to individually approve people who ask to join your team then 
   you should turn this options off (grey).
  </p>
 <p>One additional feature when you're creating a team is to select any shared locations you 
   have which would be copied to anyone joining your team.
  </p>
  <p>We created a "Try it Out" team that you can join and use to experiment with the app - create 
    rides, join and leave rides, etc.  From there you can leave and join a real team or create your own team.</p>

<p><a name="Q8"></a>8. Who can see rides that I publish?</p>
<div class="advice1">
<p>If you have joined a team (or created one) then only people who belong to that team 
  can see rides created by team members or ask to join one of those rides. 
  If you don't belong to a team then any user of the app can see your rides or ask to join your ride.</p>

</div><br /><br />

<p><a name="Q9"></a>9. Can I use the app to get in touch with my ride owner or participants?</p>
<div class="advice1">
<p>You can. There is a function to send a message to all participants in a ride or to the ride owner.</p>
<p>However, be aware that not all areas of the Bruce Power site have reliable cellular data coverage or Wifi and that some employees cannot have their mobile devices with them e.g. in the stations so a message sent via the app 
   may not be received. </p>
<p>Always have an alternate way to reach people you are sharing a ride with i.e. office, home or
mobile phone message or ask them to confirm that they have received any messages you have sent.</p>

<p><a name="Q10"></a>10. Where did the app come from? </p>
<div class="advice1">
<p>ShareRides was developed as a mentoring and skills development project at another company 
  where over 100 consultants were travelling back and forth by taxi from the same hotel to 
  the same customer site every day. The app helped them cut taxi costs significantly.</p>

<p><a name="Q11"></a>11. What about Android devices?</p>
<div class="advice1">
<p>There isn't a version of the app for Android yet. 
  If you are interested in the Android version let us know via the contact info below.</p>

<p><a name="Q12"></a>12. Where can I get more help?</p>
